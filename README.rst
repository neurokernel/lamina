Neurokernel Lamina
------------------

This project provides the tools for experimentation with the lamina LPU
in Neurokernel_ framework.

.. _Neurokernel: https://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel

The example provided has no input so it doesn't generate anything
meaningful. Lamina should be connected to a retina LPU with the expected
interface.

Installation
------------
The project can be installed by simply running: ::

    $ python setup.py install
